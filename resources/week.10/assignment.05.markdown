# Assignment #5: 10 points
## Connecting _RTcmix_ to _Unity_ 

* Create a simple Unity 'scene' using our recently-acquired synthesis and spatialization tools.
* Note: These will be SHORT sketches for _Unity_ and _RTcmix_ in which EACH STUDENT writes a short scene in Unity and integrates their own sounds into it. Later, when we do the final project, we will use our aforementioned "division of labor."
* Students may begin to collaborate and consult one another, but this project is still graded on each individual's ability to put a scene together in Unity with a focus on their own sounds. We will work on teams to complete our final "collective" course project.

<p class="redish">Choose 2 elements from the following list:</p> 

* Simple Algorithms
	* Scale generation
	* Loops
	* Random notes from a reservoir (array of notes)
	* automated FX — e.g. moving filters
	* real-time control over FX

<p class="redish">_Choose 3-4 elements from the following list:</p>

* More intricate algorithmically-generated musical sequences
* Simple Quadratic Note Generation
* Arpeggiator with real-time timbre control
* Chaotic Attractors
	* Henon Map
	* Lorenz — 2D flow of fluid, uniform depth
	* Logistic Map (a.k.a. Population Growth) 
* Noise sources, types + colors:
	* [NOISE, i.e. white noise](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/NOISE.php) 
	* [PINK](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/PINK.php)
	* [BROWN](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/BROWN.php)
	* [CRACKLE, i.e. chaotic](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/CRACKLE.php)
	* [DUST, i.e. random impulses](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/DUST.php)
	* [LATOOCARFIAN](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/LATOOCARFIAN.php)
	* [HENON](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/HENON.php)
	* [IINOISE, i.e. IIR filtered noise](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/IIR.php#IINOISE)

<p class="redish">These 5-6 elements are to be developed in your algorithmic sketch.</p>
<p class="redish">Choose 1-2 of the new RTcmix~ synthesis instruments or treatments we learned in Week 8, including those from:</p>

* Physical Modeling in _RTcmix_
* Granular Synthesis
* Modulation Synthesis 
* Additive/Subtractive Frequency-Based Synthesis 

<p class="redish">Include 1-2 new instruments as the synthesis engine(s) for your new sketch.</p>


### LENGTH
Between 2 and 4 minutes of material maximum.

### DOCUMENTATION
* Include all Max patches, samples, soundfiles, _RTcmix_ scores and _bach.roll_ text files in a single folder.
* Make this into a .zip file.
* Audio recordings should be lossless .WAV or .AIFF files in 48kHz/24-bit (i.e. sampling rate / bit rate).
* Email me the .zip file _(or send me a link to it if the archive is too large)._

### DEADLINE
* <p class="redish">Due on Sunday night, April 19, at 11:59 PM.</p>
* We'll listen and evaluate the following day (Mon. 3/23), so **no late work will be accepted.**

### GRADING
Subject to the **GENERAL GRADING RUBRIC** located in our <a href="/index.html">Course Syllabus.</a>  
_Scores will be given out of 10 points. Your grade will be based on:_
* Inventiveness of the sounds developed in Modalys and/or RTcmix.
* Creativity and thoughtfulness of your musical ideas as recorded in any MIDI roll or `bach.roll`. 
* Quality of the sound produced by your `RTcmix~` and as captured in your sound file.

### FEEDBACK
We'll have a chance for feedback in the week following the deadline.
