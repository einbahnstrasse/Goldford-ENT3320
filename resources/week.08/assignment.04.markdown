# Midterm Assignment #4: 20 points
## Algorithmic Extensions of Synthesis Processes

_Compose a short sketch for your own RTcmix~ instruments, using various combinations of the following materials covered in our recent class sessions._

_Your algorithmic sketch may be captured in a `bach.roll` or limited just to the real-time and/or scheduled loops and triggers you compose in Max using `RTcmix~`, or they may include both! (i.e. a `bach.roll` whose output controls not only RTcmix~ instruments but also algorithmic processes coded inside of RTcmix~ scripts. Ooo ahh!)_

<p class="redish">Choose 2 elements from the following list:</p> 

* Simple Algorithms
	* Scale generation
	* Loops
	* Random notes from a reservoir (array of notes)
	* automated FX — e.g. moving filters
	* real-time control over FX

<p class="redish">_Choose 3-4 elements from the following list:</p>

* More intricate algorithmically-generated musical sequences
* Simple Quadratic Note Generation
* Arpeggiator with real-time timbre control
* Chaotic Attractors
	* Henon Map
	* Lorenz — 2D flow of fluid, uniform depth
	* Logistic Map (a.k.a. Population Growth) 
* Noise sources, types + colors:
	* [NOISE, i.e. white noise](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/NOISE.php) 
	* [PINK](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/PINK.php)
	* [BROWN](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/BROWN.php)
	* [CRACKLE, i.e. chaotic](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/CRACKLE.php)
	* [DUST, i.e. random impulses](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/DUST.php)
	* [LATOOCARFIAN](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/LATOOCARFIAN.php)
	* [HENON](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/HENON.php)
	* [IINOISE, i.e. IIR filtered noise](http://rtcmix.org/reference/instruments/IIR.php#IINOISE)

<p class="redish">These 5-6 elements are to be developed in your algorithmic sketch.</p>
<p class="redish">Choose 1-2 of the new RTcmix~ synthesis instruments or treatments we learned in Week 8, including those from:</p>

* Physical Modeling in _RTcmix_
* Granular Synthesis
* Modulation Synthesis 
* Additive/Subtractive Frequency-Based Synthesis 

<p class="redish">Include 1-2 new instruments as the synthesis engine(s) for your new sketch.</p>

### CHALLENGE (Okay, so this part is NOT required!):
Look ahead to Week 9 and link your new _RTcmix_ score to a basic scene in _Unity!_ You can watch the [uRTcmix Video Tutorials](http://sites.music.columbia.edu/brad/uRTcmix/video-tutorials.html) and use the Scoralyzer to translate your _RTcmix_ code into C# code for use as an Asset in _Unity!_

### LENGTH
Between 2 and 4 minutes of material maximum.

### DOCUMENTATION
* Include all Max patches, samples, soundfiles, _RTcmix_ scores and _bach.roll_ text files in a single folder.
* Make this into a .zip file.
* Audio recordings should be lossless .WAV or .AIFF files in 48kHz/24-bit (i.e. sampling rate / bit rate).
* Email me the .zip file _(or send me a link to it if the archive is too large)._

### DEADLINE
* <p class="redish">Due on Sunday night, March 22nd, at 11:59 PM.</p>
* We'll listen and evaluate the following day (Mon. 3/23), so **no late work will be accepted.**

### GRADING
Subject to the **GENERAL GRADING RUBRIC** located in our <a href="/index.html">Course Syllabus.</a>  
_Scores will be given out of 20 points. Your grade will be based on:_
* Inventiveness of the sounds developed in Modalys and/or RTcmix.
* Creativity and thoughtfulness of your musical ideas as recorded in any MIDI roll or `bach.roll`. 
* Quality of the sound produced by your `RTcmix~` and as captured in your sound file.

### FEEDBACK
We'll have a chance for feedback in the week following the deadline.
