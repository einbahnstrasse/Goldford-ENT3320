# Short Assignment #3: 10 points
## A Physical Modeling Sampler Made from _Modalys~_

* Using what we learn this week about _ModaLisp_... 
	* Create your own physical modeling instrument with Modalys
	* Tweak the sounds using Modalys parameters until you're pleased with the result
	* Batch create multiple samples for each note of your instrument
* Keymap your samples using the `EXS24` Sampler in Logic...
	*  such that each sample is mapped to one note in the piano roll, increasing in pitch.
	* The sampler will be used to "play" your new Modalys instrument.
* Write a short musical sequence in Logic's MIDI piano roll editor.
	* Consider using the MIDI keyboard connected to your computer.
	* Your sequence should have 2-4 voices.
	* After your sound generating sampler engine, feel free to add minimal effects such as reverb, EQ, or light compression, in order to enhance the sonic properties you discover in your instruments. (For example, if you've created a resonant percussion instrument, adding a bit of reverb tail will enhance its decay.)
	* Record your sequence into a stereo sound file, which we'll use next week.
	* Consider how your chosen sound and sketch of material might be used in our final project about memory.
	* _Some excerpts may be chosen for inclusion in, or for development towards, our final project._

### LENGTH
Between 1 and 2 minutes of material maximum.

### DOCUMENTATION
* Record a soundfile playing back the sequence from your Logic sampler.  
* [Save your Logic session properly in a single folder, including all imported Modalys samples, EXS24 files, etc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs-kIMAMUVw)
* Include your Logic session and all related files, and the short audio recording of your piece in your folder 
* Make this into a .zip file.
* Audio recordings should be lossless .WAV or .AIFF files in 48kHz/24-bit (i.e. sampling rate / bit rate).
* Email me the .zip file _(or send me a link to it if the archive is too large)._

### DEADLINE
* <p class="redish">Due on Sunday night, March 8th, at 11:59 PM.</p>
* As we will be immediately using your work the following day (Mon. 3/9), **no late work will be accepted.**

### GRADING
Subject to the **GENERAL GRADING RUBRIC** located in our <a href="/index.html">Course Syllabus.</a>  
_Scores will be given out of 10 points. Your grade will be based on:_
* Inventiveness of the sounds developed in Modalys.
* Creativity and thoughtfulness of your musical ideas as recorded in the MIDI roll.
* Quality of the sound produced by your `RTcmix~` and as captured in your sound file.

### FEEDBACK
We won't be evaluating these in class on their own; instead, we'll use our sequences as sound file triggers in Unity. So, we'll listen to and evaluate these next week together with a visual component...
