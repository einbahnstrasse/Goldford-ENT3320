# Syllabus
### I. Course Description

In this technical production course, students will collaborate on a team to create an immersive VR environment with interactive sound and music. Our goal will be an expressive VR experience with interactive audio rather than simply a game with fixed sound files. 

Emphasis will be on sound and music _within_ VR, and not sound that merely _accompanies_ a visual world. We'll consider excerpts from film and periodic readings to better undertand the role sound plays in any audio-visual experience. Our soundtracks will become vital components of the virtual experience, and as such we'll be using tools for real-time music generation alongside those that allow us to shape recorded and environmental sounds, etc. In doing so, we'll also ponder the question: _What is the relationship between sounds found in nature and those found in music?_

The theme for this semester’s project will be `MEMORY`. Together we'll develop a narrative around how a person’s daily activities can be interrupted and shaped by their memories and their dreams. To do this, we’ll be embedding a real-time music and sound synthesis program inside Unity. This means that as a person moves through our VR scenes, their actions will trigger certain aspects of the music and the sound; not the other way around.

### VI. Inclusivity
#### 1. Name + Pronoun Usage
As this course includes group work and in-class discussion, it is vitally important for us to create an adtmosphere of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor of necessary changes.

#### 2. Inclusion Statement 
_It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups._
