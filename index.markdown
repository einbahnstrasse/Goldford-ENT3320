<a id="descr"></a>
### II. Course Description
In this technical production course, students will collaborate on a team to create an immersive VR environment with interactive sound and music. Our goal will be an expressive VR experience with interactive audio rather than simply a game with fixed sound files. 
Emphasis will be on sound and music within VR, and not sound that merely accompanies a visual world. We’ll consider excerpts from film and periodic readings to better understand the role sound plays in any audio-visual experience. Our soundtracks will become vital components of the virtual experience, and as such we’ll be using tools for real-time music generation alongside those that allow us to shape recorded and environmental sounds, etc.

The theme for this semester’s project will be `MEMORY`. Together we’ll develop a narrative around how a person’s daily activities can be interrupted and shaped by their memories and their dreams. To do this, we’ll be embedding a real-time music and sound synthesis program called RTcmix inside Unity. We’ll briefly visit the concepts of spatialization and physical modeling synthesis using the programs Spat and Modalys. 

* * *

<a id="goals"></a>
### III. Course Goals
_To create an immersive VR experience with algorithmically-generated audio and music while:_  
* Introducing students to the RTcmix sound synthesis programming language  
* Refining students’ workflow/workspace in MaxMSP, especially as related to the development of polyphonic synthesizers and in composing scheduled sequences of music and audio  
* Adding new libraries for synthesis and spatialization to students’ creative “toolkits”  
* Embedding RTcmix within Unity; to import composed/sculpted sound into a gaming engine  
* Storyboarding and designing a narrative around a central theme  

* * *

<a id="outcomes"></a>
### IV. Learning Outcomes
_By the end of the course students will be able to:_
* **Create** original music and sound sequences using MaxMSP and RTcmix.   
* **Understand** the fundamentals of poly~ design in Max.  
* **Implement** a personal workspace for creating sound using the bach Library for Max.  
<!-- * **Spatialize** and **Localize** audio sources inside Unity using Spat and RTcmix.   -->
<!-- * **Record,** Edit, and **Chroma Key** video clips to be used as assets in Unity.   -->
* **Establish** a personal creative vision, and communicate it to your team member(s).

<a id="expect"></a>
### VI. Expectations
* **Arrive on time** and attend all classes — _See Attendance + Participation Policy below._
* Spend at least **1-4 additional hours a week** _(outside of class)_ on the timely completion of all class assignments, readings, and your contributions towards our final project _(i.e. developing and revising your sounds, animation and/or video elements, etc.)._
* **Back up and organize your work REGULARLY** on external media and/or your preferred cloud. _Catastrophic loss of materials is no excuse for missed deadlines!_ Some tips...
	* Use **GIT** where appropriate — e.g. for your Max patches and other text files, etc. 
	* Adopt an **incremental backup** file-naming system of your choice, as appropriate (e.g. _MySound-v856.wav_ is more effective than _MySound-FinalVersionThisTimeIPromise.wav_).
* **Bring headphones and an appropriate audio jack** to all classes. You will need these for all work in Max, Unity, etc. 
* **Push yourself creatively and technically.** Be ambitious. Work hard. _Stay open and curious!_
* Listening to or watching any media in class (other than what is assigned) is strictly prohibited. 
* **No smartphones or mobile devices.** You may charge them out-of-sight. 

* * *

<a id="comm"></a>
### VII. Communication
* Weekly course sessions will be held on Zoom. Use the recurring virtual Zoom classroom link emailed to you at the start of the semester.
* City Tech email accounts are our official means of communication, but we will also use Slack for additional discussion.  
* **Requests to the instructor for assistance**: Send an email, or a message on Slack. I will respond during normal working hours; requests arriving "after hours" will be answered on subsequent weekdays.
* [Professional communication etiquette](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/professional-email-salutations){:target="_blank"} is expected in our written correspondence. In emails and messages, this includes polite and appropriate salutations, greetings, and courtesies.
* **Virtual office hours are available through my Calendly link** (see I. Essential Course + Contact Information, above). If you are frequently missing from class discussions, missing lab assignments, or demonstrating poor comprehension of our materials, **I may occasionally _require_ office hours visits with you, in which case I’ll send you a message through Slack or in an email. It is my expectation that you respond promptly and sign up for a time** to discuss any such perceived issues, and failure to do so will be reflected in negative participation points. 
* Slack should be used during regular hours. Please respond during the workday as promptly as you can to inquiries from the instructor (both for email and messages sent on Slack). Multiple successive days without a response is unacceptable.
* **Actively participate** in our online class discussions. **Thoughtfully contribute to a positive classroom environment**, while supporting and challenging your colleagues’ ideas.
* **Check Slack and email regularly** for group and private messages.
* If you have a question that may be relevant to the group (about assignments, etc.), post in the #general channel on Slack.
* Use Slack for easy communications with your classmates as well — you can DM individuals or selected groups.

* * *

<a id="zoom"></a>
### VIII. Attendance + Participation Policy
_Your participation will form the bulk of your grade in this class._
* Students are expected to arrive promptly to all class sessions and to participate and engage in our activities, discussions, group project work and individual assignments. 
* Follow this **Procedure for Absences:**
	* Contact a classmate for notes on what you missed (e.g. on Slack).
	* Check our Course Website for assignments. 
	* After these 2 steps, contact the instructor for any additional questions.
* **Excused absences/lateness must be accompanied by documentation** and/or include advance notice with the instructor where possible. Excused absences/lateness will not impact on your grade. Absences may be excused in cases of: documentation of illness provided by a doctor, religious observance with advance notice, official school-related activity (always with documentation and advanced notice), and on a case-by-case basis for other critical events with similar advance notice, at the discretion of the instructor. 
* _A lack of communication with the instructor about any planned absence will therefore be treated as unexcused. Be in touch early about any such absences._ 
* **Unexcused absences/lateness result in lowered participation grades.** Prompt 11:30 (2:30) arrival earns you an immediate 5 points (i.e. full participation) but is subject to your engagement in class. For arrivals after 6:00, the following weighted score system will be adopted:  

<a id="arrival"></a>
<div class="latetable">
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="30%" />
<col width="70%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Arrival ("Sign-on") Time</th>
<th>Participation Points</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">11:30/2:30 or earlier</td>
<td markdown="span">5 points (full credit)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">11:31/2:31—11:40/2:40</td>
<td markdown="span">4 points</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">11:41/2:41—12:00/3:00</td>
<td markdown="span">3 points</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">12:01/3:01—12:30/3:30</td>
<td markdown="span">2 points</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">after 12:30/3:30</td>
<td markdown="span">1 point</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td markdown="span">absent</td>
<td markdown="span">0 points</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

* Your engagement in class will be corroborated with points incurred by your arrival time for the complete participation score in each session (out of 5 points total). In other words, to a limited extent points can be earned back through active engagement and contribution. So for a 12:00 arrival, for example, positively contributing can still increase your score beyond 1 point. 
* **Three (3) unexcused absences** will lower your final course grade by 10% (i.e. one letter grade).
* **Each additional unexcused absence** will further lower it by 5%.
* Quietly and occasionally excuse yourself for restroom breaks or to take an important phone call. Frequent and recurring self-excusals, or those made for any other reason (e.g. to get food from the vending machine) will also result in lowered participation marks.
* We depend on everyone’s presence and full participation because our work is collaborative. _Your participation will therefore impact everyone else in the class._
* **Assignment critiques are mandatory** and cannot be made up. Missing a critique will result in a deduction of one letter grade for the corresponding assignment.
* **Slack notifications must be enabled during regular hours (between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on weekdays)**, and must check their University email accounts regularly (recommended at least once per day where possible) for communication within and between teams, as well links to our online sessions, and details about our evolving project and course structure.

* Students and all others who work with information, ideas, texts, images, music, inventions, and other intellectual property owe their audience and sources accuracy and honesty in using, crediting, and citing sources. As a community of intellectual and professional workers, the university recognizes its responsibility for providing instruction in information literacy and academic integrity, offering models of good practice, and responding vigilantly and appropriately to infractions of academic integrity. Accordingly, academic dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York and at New York City College of Technology and is punishable by penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion. The complete text of the College policy on Academic Integrity may be found in the catalog.
* Instructor Note: Code borrowed from another source must be attributed as a comment within your own code. If you are unsure of whether or not your work may constitute plagiarism, please check with the instructor before submitting. Where applicable and where marked within our course materials, follow the provisions of the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/){:target="_blank"}  

<a id="integrity-pledge"></a> 
#### IX. Part II. Academic Integrity Pledge
By enrolling in this course, you pledge to uphold the policy on Academic Integrity described below:

I understand the value of personal integrity and ethical behavior in all aspects of my professional and personal life. By committing to honesty and personal responsibility, I earn the respect and trust of others. As a student at New York City College of Technology, I recognize that the value of my education is not just being able to say I am a college graduate, but it also incorporates the skills, values, and knowledge I have acquired. I thus commit myself to upholding academic integrity as an important aspect of my personal integrity and professional growth. I understand that academic integrity includes:  

1. Fully observing the rules governing exams and assignments regarding resource material, electronic aids, copying, collaborating with others, or engaging in any other behavior that subverts the purpose of the exam or assignment, and the directions of the instructor.   
2. Only turning in work that I have done myself, and not using unattributed work done by others. While working and studying with others can be an effective way to learn, submitted work will be my own.
3. Giving full and proper credit to sources and references, and acknowledging the contributions and ideas of others, in my academic work.
4. Further, I have read and understand the college’s Academic Integrity Policy found in the New York City College of Technology College Catalog, p. 56 of the spring 2020 catalog: [http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/catalog/docs/catalog.pdf#page=56](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/catalog/docs/catalog.pdf#page=56){:target="_blank"}

### XI. Course Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Student Support Services Program (SSSP). Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with Ms. Linda Buist, the program manager of SSSP (Phone: 718–260–5143, e-mail: lbuist@citytech.cuny.edu). If you have already registered with SSSP, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her/them.  

#### A Note on City Tech’s Counseling Center
The Counseling Services Center supports the educational, emotional and career development of City Tech students by providing opportunities for skill development, counseling and referrals that address obstacles to success. The Center is currently available to students remotely. For questions and appointments, contact the Center at counseling@citytech.cuny.edu or 718-260-5030.  

* * *

<a id="inclusivity"></a>
### XII. Inclusivity
#### XII. Part I. Name + Pronoun Usage
This course consists of individual work and group discussion. We must therefore strive to create an atmosphere of inclusion and mutual respect: all students will have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name recognized. If the class roster does not align with your name, gender, and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor.

#### XII. Part II. Inclusivity Statement
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as an asset, resource, strength, and benefit, rather than a checklist item or worse, a hindrance. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know about ways to improve the effectiveness of this course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. Feel free to reach out to me via email at any time about issues concerning you or with any such ideas.
