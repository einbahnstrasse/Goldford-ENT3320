### II. Contact Information
In this technical production course, students will collaborate on a team to create an immersive VR environment with interactive sound and music. Our goal will be an expressive VR experience with interactive audio rather than simply a game with fixed sound files. 
Emphasis will be on sound and music within VR, and not sound that merely accompanies a visual world. We’ll consider excerpts from film and periodic readings to better understand the role sound plays in any audio-visual experience. Our soundtracks will become vital components of the virtual experience, and as such we’ll be using tools for real-time music generation alongside those that allow us to shape recorded and environmental sounds, etc.

The theme for this semester’s project will be MEMORY. Together we’ll develop a narrative around how a person’s daily activities can be interrupted and shaped by their memories and their dreams. To do this, we’ll be embedding a real-time music and sound synthesis program called RTcmix inside Unity. We’ll briefly visit the concepts of spatialization and physical modeling synthesis using the programs Spat and Modalys. 

* * *

### III. Course Goals
* To create an immersive VR experience with algorithmically-generated audio and music while:
* Introducing students to the RTcmix sound synthesis programming language 
* Refining students’ workflow/workspace in MaxMSP, especially as related to the development of polyphonic synthesizers and in composing scheduled sequences of music and audio
* Adding new libraries for synthesis and spatialization to students’ creative “toolkits”
* Embedding RTcmix within Unity; to import composed/sculpted sound into a gaming engine
* Storyboarding and designing a narrative around a central theme

* * *

### IV. Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course students will be able to:
* **Create** original music and sound sequences using MaxMSP, RTcmix, and Modalys. 
* **Understand** the fundamentals of poly~ design in Max.
* **Implement** a personal workspace for creating sound using the bach Library for Max.
* **Spatialize** and **Localize** audio sources inside Unity using Spat and RTcmix.
* **Record,** Edit, and **Chroma Key** video clips to be used as assets in Unity.
* **Establish** a personal creative vision, and communicate it to your team member(s).
* **Implement** a shared workspace repository and develop work collectively. 
* **Respect,** and **Respond** to the ideas and the critique of peers and team members.

### VI. Expectations
* **Arrive on time** and attend all classes — _See Attendance + Participation Policy below._
* Spend at least **1-4 additional hours a week** _(outside of class)_ on the timely completion of all class assignments, readings, and your contributions towards our final project _(i.e. developing and revising your sounds, animation and/or video elements, etc.)._
* **Back up and organize your work REGULARLY** on external media and/or your preferred cloud. _Catastrophic loss of materials is no excuse for missed deadlines!_ Some tips...
	* Use **GIT** where appropriate — e.g. for your Max patches and other text files, etc. 
	* Adopt an **incremental backup** file-naming system of your choice, as appropriate (e.g. _MySound-v856.wav_ is more effective than _MySound-FinalVersionThisTimeIPromise.wav_).
* **Bring headphones and an appropriate audio jack** to all classes. You will need these for all work in Max, Unity, etc. 
* **Push yourself creatively and technically.** Be ambitious. Work hard. _Stay open and curious!_
* **Please do not modify desktop settings** and do not leave any files on the desktop. 
* No installation of software unless directed by your instructor. 
* Listening to or watching any media in class (other than what is assigned) is strictly prohibited. 
* **No smartphones or mobile devices.** You may charge them out-of-sight. 
* Personal laptops may be used only for related class activities.
* **No food in V103A,** except beverages in a capped/sealed bottle.

* * *

### VII. Communication
* Our City Tech email accounts are the official line of communication in this course, but we may also use Slack for group discussion and collaboration, developing ideas, etc.
* **Requests to the instructor for assistance:** send an email. It will be responded to during normal working hours. After hours requests will be answered ASAP on the next weekday. 
* **Actively participate** in our class discussions & group critiques. **Thoughtfully contribute to a positive classroom environment,** while supporting and challenging your colleagues’ ideas.
* **Check Slack** regularly for group and private messages.
* If you have a question that may be relevant to the group (about assingments, etc.), post in the #general channel on Slack for all to see and comment on.
* Use Slack for easy communications with your classmates as well — you can DM individuals or selected groups.

* * *

### VIII. Attendance + Participation Policy
* Your participation will form the bulk of your grade in this class.
* Students are expected to arrive promptly to all class sessions and to participate and engage in our activities, discussions, group project work and individual assignments. 
* Follow this **Procedure for Absences:**
	* Contact a classmate for notes on what you missed (e.g. on Slack).
	* Check our Course Website for assignments. 
	* After these 2 steps, contact the instructor for any additional questions.
* **Excused absences/lateness must be accompanied by documentation** and/or include advance notice with the instructor where possible. Excused absences/lateness will not impact on your grade. Absences may be excused in cases of: documentation of illness provided by a doctor, religious observance with advance notice, official school-related activity (always with documentation and advanced notice), and on a case-by-case basis for other critical events with similar advance notice, at the discretion of the instructor. 
* _A lack of communication with the instructor about any planned absence will therefore be treated as unexcused. Be in touch early about any such absences._ 
* **Unexcused absences/lateness result in lowered participation grades.** Prompt 6:00 arrival earns you an immediate 5 points (i.e. full participation) but is subject to your engagement in class. For arrivals after 6:00, the following weighted score system will be adopted:

| 6:01-6:10 | 4 points |
| 6:10-6:30 | 3 points |
| 6:30-7:00 | 2 points |
| after 7:00 | 1 point |
| absent    | 0 point |

* Your engagement in class will be corroborated with points incurred by your arrival time for the complete participation score in each session (out of 5 points total). In other words, to a limited extent points can be earned back through active engagement and contribution. So for a 7:00 arrival, for example, positively contributing can still increase your score beyond 1 point. 
* **Three (3) unexcused absences** will lower your final course grade by 10% (i.e. one letter grade).
* **Each additional unexcused absence** will further lower it by 5%.
* Quietly and occasionally excuse yourself for restroom breaks or to take an important phone call. Frequent and recurring self-excusals, or those made for any other reason (e.g. to get food from the vending machine) will also result in lowered participation marks.
* We depend on everyone’s presence and full participation because our work is collaborative. _Your participation will therefore impact everyone else in the class._
* **Assignment critiques are mandatory** and cannot be made up. Missing a critique will result in a deduction of one letter grade for the corresponding assignment.

### XII. Inclusivity
#### 1. Name + Pronoun Usage
This course consists of group work and discussion. We must therefore strive to create an atmosphere of inclusion and mutual respect: all students will have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name recognized. If the class roster does not align with your name, gender, and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor.

#### 2. Inclusion Statement 
_It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups._
